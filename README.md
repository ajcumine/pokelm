# PokElm

A Pok√©dex written in Elm hosted at https://ajcumine.github.io/pokelm/ using GitHub Pages.

### Development

Uses node/yarn for build and development tooling

Build the `elm.js` output file:

```
yarn build
```

Run a development server hosting static files watching and building updates from the `/src` directory:

```
yarn dev
```

Run a static server from the current `elm.js` build file:

```
yarn start
```

### Blog

This project was made as I learnt to use Elm. A complete write up of my train of thought while building this is [here](/BLOG.md). I will try to keep this relatively up to date as I continue work on this project.
